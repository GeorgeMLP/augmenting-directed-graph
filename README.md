# Augmenting Directed Graph

A strongly connected graph is a directed graph that has a path from each vertex to every other vertex. This programme augments a directed graph into a strongly connected graph by adding the least edges possible. 

Take the graph below for example. This graph is a directed graph, but is not strongly connected (for instance, point 3 does not connect to any other point). 

![A directed graph that is not strongly connected.](https://github.com/GeorgeMLP/augmenting-directed-graph/raw/master/Figures/Fig.%201.png)

We can augment this graph by adding 2 edges to make it strongly connected, as shown in the figure below. 

![Augmented graph that is strongly connected.](https://github.com/GeorgeMLP/augmenting-directed-graph/raw/master/Figures/Fig.%202.png)

It can be proven that 2 is the least amount of edges possible to make this graph strongly connected. 

## Input and output

A directed graph can be expressed by an *adjacency matrix*. For a directed graph with ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n) points, its adjacency matrix has a order of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n), composed of 0 and 1. If the element in the ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i\mathrm{th}) row and the ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?j\mathrm{th}) column is 1, then there is a edge from point ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i) to point ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?j). Otherwise there are no such edges. For example, the adjacency matrix of the directed graph mentioned above is shown in the figure below.

Input a directed graph using its adjacency matrix in the following form:

```
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
```

And the programme will output the adjacency matrix of the augmented graph:

```
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
